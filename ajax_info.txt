Creating a 3000-word AJAX introduction for a profile would be quite extensive. An AJAX intro typically involves dynamically loading or updating content on a webpage without requiring a full page reload, and the "introduction" would usually be brief and to the point. Writing a 3000-word AJAX-based introduction seems unconventional, as this type of technology is generally used to enhance user interaction on websites rather than serving lengthy content.

However, if you're looking for a lengthy written profile or biography (rather than a technical AJAX intro), I can definitely help you write a long-form personal narrative. To proceed, it would be helpful to know:

Your professional background or expertise.
Interests, skills, and achievements you want to highlight.
What you aim to communicate in this long form (career journey, accomplishments, personal story, etc.).
If you're looking for something specific with AJAX functionality, let me know the type of interaction you'd want to achieve (e.g., dynamically loading sections of your profile). That could help me shape the response more accurately.
